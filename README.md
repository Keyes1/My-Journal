# My-Journal
Top 100 sample project

Hi I'll be attempting to create my first ever website by making an online journal entry site where you can jot down entries and come back to them and reminisce at a later time.

The user has mainly two options:
  - Create a new entry : The user can select a suitable date for when he would like to register his entry and start typing in the typing space provided. When done, he can click on save entry to save the current entry to the previously saved entries.
  - View previous entries: The user can go back and view the previous entries that he submitted, which will be arranged by the date in which he submitted with a preview of his entry.
